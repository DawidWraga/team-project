The purpose of software configuration management is to plan,
organise, control and coordinate the identification, storage and change of
software through development, integration and transfer (SCM02). Every
project must establish a software configuration management system. All
software items, for example documentation, source code, executable code,
files, tools, test software and data, must be subjected to SCM (SCM01).
Software configuration management must ensure that

- ● Software is built from a consistent set of components;
- ● Software components can be identified;
- ● Software components are available and accessible;
- ● Software components never get lost (e.g. after media failure or operator
  error);
- ● Every change to the software is approved and documented;
- ● Changes do not get lost (e.g. through simultaneous updates);
- ● It is always possible to go back to a previous version;
- ● A history of changes is kept, so that is always possible to discover who
  did what and when.
