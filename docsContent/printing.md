## What is a printer and why do we have them?

In computing, a printer is a peripheral machine which makes a persistent representation of graphics or text, usually on paper. While most output is human-readable, bar code printers are an example of an expanded use for printers. Different types of printers include 3D printers, inkjet printers, laser printers, and thermal printers.

## History of the printer

The first computer printer designed was a mechanically driven apparatus by Charles Babbage for his difference engine in the 19th century; however, his mechanical printer design was not built until 2000.

The first commercial printers generally used mechanisms from electric typewriters and Teletype machines. The demand for higher speed led to the development of new systems specifically for computer use. In the 1980s there were daisy wheel systems similar to typewriters, line printers that produced similar output but at much higher speed, and dot-matrix systems that could mix text and graphics but produced relatively low-quality output. The plotter was used for those requiring high-quality line art like blueprints.

## Printer Instructions

### Loading Paper

You can print on photo paper, index cards, or L-size cards.

- ● Before loading paper, slide out the paper-width guide to make room for the paper.
- ● Load only one type and size of paper at a time. Do not mix paper types or sizes in
  the In tray.
- ● Do not load more than 10 sheets of 10 x 30 cm (4 x 12 inches) photo paper for
  panoramic printing (possible only when printing from a computer). Loading more
  than ten sheets can cause paper feed problems.
